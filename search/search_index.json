Do you want to be able to choose the best framework after simply performing performance measurements? This framework unifies multiple Panda-compatible components, to allow the writing of a single code, compatible with all. Synopsis With some parameters and Virtual classes, it's possible to write a code, and execute this code: - With or without multicore - With or without cluster (multi nodes) - With or without GPU To do that, we create some virtual classes, add some methods in others classes, etc. It's difficult to use a combinaison of framework, with the same classe name, with similare semantic, etc. For example, if you want to use in the same program, Dask, cudf, pandas and modin, you must manage: - pandas.DataFrame , pandas,Series - modin.pandas.DataFrame , modin.pandas.Series - cudf.DataFrame , cudf.Series - dask.DataFrame , dask.Series With cudf , the code must call .to_pandas() . With dask, the code must call .compute() , can use @delayed or dask.distributed.Client . etc. We propose to replace all these classes and scenarios, with a uniform model , inspired by dask (the more complex API). Then, it is possible to write one code, and use it in differents environnements and frameworks. This project is essentially a back-port of Dask+Cudf to others frameworks. To reduce the confusion, you must use the classes VDataFrame and VSeries (The prefix V is for Virtual ). These classes propose the methods .to_pandas() and .compute() for each version, but are the real classes of the selected framework. A new @delayed annotation can be use, with or without Dask. With some parameters, the real classes may be pandas.DataFrame , modin.pandas.DataFrame , cudf.DataFrame , dask.dataframe.DataFrame with Pandas or dask.dataframe.DataFrame with cudf (with Pandas or cudf for each partition). To manage the initialisation of a Dask or Ray cluster, you must use the VClient() . This alias, can be automatically initialized with some environment variables. # Sample of code, compatible Pandas, cudf, modin, dask and dask_cudf from virtual_dataframe import * TestDF = VDataFrame with (VClient()): @delayed def my_function(data: TestDF) -> TestDF: return data rc = my_function(VDataFrame({\"data\": [1, 2]}, npartitions=2)) print(rc.to_pandas()) With this framework, you can select your environment, to run or debug your code. env Environement VDF_MODE=pandas Only Python with classical pandas VDF_MODE=modin Python with local modin VDF_MODE=cudf Python with local cuDF (GPU) VDF_MODE=dask Dask with local multiple process and pandas VDF_MODE=dask-cudf Dask with local multiple process and cuDF VDF_MODE=dask DEBUG=True Dask with single thread and pandas VDF_MODE=dask-cudf DEBUG=True Dask with single thread and cuDF VDF_MODE=dask VDF_CLUSTER=dask://localhost Dask with local cluster and pandas VDF_MODE=dask-cudf VDF_CLUSTER=dask://localhost Dask with local cuda cluster and cuDF VDF_MODE=dask VDF_CLUSTER=dask://...:ppp Dask with remote cluster and Pandas VDF_MODE=dask-cudf VDF_CLUSTER=dask://...:ppp Dask with remote cluster and cuDF VDF_MODE=dask-modin VDF_CLUSTER=dask://localhost Dask with local cluster and modin VDF_MODE=ray-modin VDF_CLUSTER=ray://localhost Ray with local cluster and modin VDF_MODE=dask-modin VDF_CLUSTER=dask://...:ppp Dask with remote cluster and modin VDF_MODE=ray-modin VDF_CLUSTER=ray://...:ppp Ray with remote cluster and modin The real compatibilty between the differents simulation of Pandas, depends on the implement of the modin, cudf or dask. Sometime, you can use the VDF_MODE variable, to update some part of code, between the selected backend. It's not always easy to write a code compatible with all scenario, but it's possible. Generally, add just .compute() and/or .to_pandas() at the end of the ETL, is enough. But, you must use, only the common feature with all frameworks. After this effort, it's possible to compare the performance about the differents technologies, or propose a component, compatible with differents scenario. For the deployment of your project, you can select the best framework for your process (in a dockerfile?), with only one ou two environment variable.

Best practices For write a code, optimized with all frameworks, you must use some best practices .\" Use read file It's not a good idea to use the constructor of VDataFrame or VSeries because, all the datas must be in memory in the driver. If the dataframe is big, an out of memory can happen. To partitionning the job, create multiple files, and use read_csv(\"filename*.csv\") or other file format. Then, each worker can read directly a partition. The constructor for VDataFrame and VSeries are present, only to help to write some unit test, but may not be used in production. No loop It's not a good idea to iterate over row of DataFrame. Some framework are very slow with this approach. It's better to use apply() or apply_rows() to distribute the code in the cluster and GPU. The code used in apply , will be compiled to CPU or GPU, before using, with some frameworks. FAQ The code run with dask, but not with modin, pandas or cudf ? You must use only the similare functionality, and only a subpart of Pandas. Develop for dask_cudf . it's easier to be compatible with others frameworks. .compute() is not defined with pandas, cudf ? If your @delayed function return something, other than a VDataFrame or VSerie , the objet has not the method .compute() . You can solve this, with: @delayed def f()-> int: return 42 real_result,=compute(f()) # Warning, compute return a tuple.
